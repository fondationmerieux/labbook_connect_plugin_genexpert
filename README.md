# GeneXpert – LabBook Connect plugin

This plugin enables communication between a Cepheid GeneXpert analyzer and LabBook.
The analyzer communicates using ASTM only; HL7 is used exclusively toward the LIS.

## Installation note

This bundle is NOT a ready-to-use directory.

Files must be installed individually, either:
- by copying them manually to their corresponding locations on the server, or
- by uploading them through the LabBook user interface (when supported).

The analyzer setting file is a sample and MUST be edited before use
(network parameters, analyzer ID, URLs).

Do not deploy the bundle as a single directory.

## Communication protocols

- Analyzer ↔ LabBook Connect: ASTM E1381 over TCP socket
- LabBook Connect ↔ LIS: HL7 v2.5.1 (HTTP)

## Supported transactions

- LAB-27 (Query)  
  ASTM Q| (analyzer) → HL7 QBP^Q11 (to LIS)  
  HL7 RSP^K11 (from LIS) → ASTM (to analyzer)

- LAB-28 (Orders)  
  HL7 OML^O33 (from LIS) → ASTM (to analyzer)

- LAB-29 (Results)  
  ASTM (from analyzer) → HL7 OUL^R22 (to LIS)

## Deployment modes

- server (validated, production mode)  
  LabBook Connect listens on a TCP port and waits for the analyzer connection.

- client (experimental)  
  LabBook Connect connects to the analyzer IP/port.  
  Not recommended for production use.

## Configuration files

Two configuration files are required for each GeneXpert analyzer instance:
- one analyzer setting file (connection and routing)
- one mapping file (tests and result mapping)

### 1) Analyzer settings

Location:  
    /storage/resource/connect/analyzer/setting/

Sample file:  
    doc/analyzer_genexpert.toml

Important:
- The operator MUST edit this file before use.
- In server mode, the ip field is ignored.
- In client mode (experimental), the ip field is required.
- Allowed TCP port ranges:
  - 7500–7599
  - 12300–12399

### 2) Mapping file

Location:  
    /storage/resource/connect/analyzer/mapping/

Sample file:  
    doc/mapping_genexpert.toml

Notes:
- Only tests explicitly listed are supported.
- Additional tests and result mappings must be added as needed.

## GeneXpert limitation

The test code sent to GeneXpert (Host Test Code / ASTM O segment, field O|...^^^CODE)
MUST be 15 characters or less.

Longer codes may be accepted by LabBook but cause GeneXpert results
to be received without being correctly matched or displayed.

## Logging

- Logs use the global LabBook Connect logging configuration.
- Low-level ASTM traffic (ENQ, ACK, frames) is logged for diagnostic purposes.

## Message archiving

Message archiving is controlled by the `archive_msg` setting in the analyzer configuration file.

When enabled (`archive_msg = "Y"`), raw messages are archived on disk for traceability and diagnostics.

Archived messages are stored per analyzer instance in:
    /storage/resource/connect/analyzer/{id_analyzer}/

Subdirectories:
- archive_lab27 (LAB-27 queries)
- archive_lab28 (LAB-28 orders)
- archive_lab29 (LAB-29 results)

Messages are saved as plain text files.
Filenames include the transaction type, message source (Analyzer or LIS), and a timestamp.

## Limitations

- No automatic frame retransmission on ASTM NAK (send side).
- Client mode is experimental.
- RSP^K11 responses always terminate with L|1|N.

## Versioning

- Plugin version is embedded in the JAR.
- Setting and mapping files have independent versions.
